A loving husband, devoted father, generous friend, masterful story-teller, and fierce patriot, Bob lived life fully, with dignity, honor, style, and purpose. He defended our country in war, and fought passionately for human rights and civil rights in peace. A war hero who hated war, Bob was awarded the Bronze Star, French Legion of Honor, and Russian Hero of the Great Patriotic War. He landed on D-Day, fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and served in four other campaigns in World War II. He lived every day with memories of his remarkable Band of Brothers--those courageous and vulnerable young men, of every race, class, religion, and region, who served with him and did not have the good fortune to return home. He leaves behind his loving wife, Alene, his daughter (Elizabeth) and three sons (Michael, Joshua, and Ken), and eight grandchildren (Daniel, Stephen, Jessica, Lucas, Isabel, Douglas, Ondine, and Caleb). We all love him and miss him.", "slideshow_credits": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "COHEN, ROBERT"}], "pub_date": "2014-08-03T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "abstract": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E2D7173AF930A3575BC0A9629D8B63"}
