The Board of Trustees, faculty, administration, students, and alumni of the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies mourn the passing of Arnold Bernstein, PhD. In 1972, he and other psychoanalysts founded CMPS in order to train people in the theory and technique of modern psychoanalysis. In his capacity as founder, faculty, analyst, supervisor, and Board member, he touched the lives of an incalculable number of people. It is fitting to note that he passed away while dressing to go to his office to his first analysand of the day. His intellect was vast but not more so than his humanity. He was the epitome of a truly therapeutic personality.
