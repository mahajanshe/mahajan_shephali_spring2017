He is survived by his devoted wife of 28 years, Carmen Gallego, his five children and their spouses: Elaine and John Postley, Janet and Tony Barton, Dr. Donald McNicol, Christena and Paul McNicol and Andrea Gallego McNicol, his grandchildren: John Postley, Scott and Chris Barton, Will and Katie McNicol and Campbell McNicol, and his great grandchildren: Beatrix and Griffin Postley, Oscar and Hunter Barton, and Henry and Charlotte Barton. Don McNicol was a gentleman, an athlete and a scholar. He was a great Harvard football player, War Class of 1943. He married the late Doris Egues in 1943, became a father in December, 1944 and went to War 10 days later. He was 23. 15 months later, he returned, graduating from the Harvard Law School in 1947. He joined the esteemed firm of Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Sunderland & Kendall as an associate. Later he formed his own distinguished firm, Hall, McNicol, Hamilton & Clark. Throughout his life, he served on numerous business, philanthropic and club boards, including the Harvard Club of New York City, the Boys & Girls Club of America, American Maize-Products Company and currently, the Thomas Publishing Company. He loved the game of golf, playing at home and at the world's great courses (including the great Scottish Link courses) with his two sons. Fishing was a passion in Montauk, Canada, Europe, Florida and the Carribean, imbuing his sons with the same enthusiasm. He loved his boat, \"Man O War\" and the \"Mosquito Fleet,\" a small flotilla comprised of his sons, his pals and his brave wife, Carmen, which \"cruised\" around \"intrepidly\" in bad weather and worse seas. All in good fun.
