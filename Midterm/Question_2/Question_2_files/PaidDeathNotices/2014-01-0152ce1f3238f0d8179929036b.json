The Board and Staff of Lincoln Center Theater are deeply saddened by the death of our beloved Anna Crouse. A longtime Director and an Honorary Trustee for many years, Anna was passionate about the Theater, particularly our theater. She was feisty, informed, enthusiastic, intelligent, opinionated, generous and always loving, always caring. Indeed, Lincoln Center Theater probably would not exist today without Anna's early advocacy and devotion. We extend our sympathy and love to Tim and Lindsay who took such magnificent care of their mother in recent years. Anna was a formidable figure, and we will miss her every single day. J.
