The Trustees and staff of The Noguchi Museum join with the many who mourn the passing of the indefatigable and ever charming Priscilla Morgan, a founding member of the board and our first Honorary Life Trustee. A force of nature she stood loyally and steadfastly for all she believed in. Precise and high standards defined her and she brought these to the relationships and organizations she so dedicated herself to. Key amongst these was her love for Isamu Noguchi and by extension his Museum which she not only assisted in founding, but continually affirmed, and in her inimitable way helped lead. Her sparkle, her great stories, her mercurial ways and underlying warmth touched all who knew her. She will remain a guiding light to the Noguchi Museum as we move forward. We shall miss her inexplicably. David D. Holbrook, Chairman Jenny Dixon, Director", "slideshow_credits": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MORGAN, PRISCILLA"}], "pub_date": "2014-04-01T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "abstract": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E5DC133AF932A35757C0A9629D8B63"}
