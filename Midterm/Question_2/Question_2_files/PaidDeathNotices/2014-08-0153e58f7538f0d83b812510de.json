The trustees and staff of the American Museum in Britain express our deepest sorrow at the death of our good friend and museum patron, Alice Avery. Alice, a dedicated traveler of Museum tours since 1978 and who easily won the count of being the most traveled supporter and patron, starting her trips with Director Ian McCallum, and following with Bill McNaught, Sandra Barghini and most recently, Richard Wendorf. She was not only the most traveled of our life members, but also someone who was always generous in entertaining Museum members on the trips to Los Angeles. She lived a long life and even towards the end displayed enthusiasm for new experiences and had a memory, all of us would be pleased to call our own. Her generosity, dedication and friendship will be deeply missed. Alfred M. Vinton, Chairman Mark E. Haranzo, Deputy Chairman American Museum in Britain Linda Hackett, President Halcyon Foundation", "slideshow_credits": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "AVERY, ALICE O'NEILL"}], "pub_date": "2014-08-01T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "abstract": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E4D8173AF932A3575BC0A9629D8B63"}
