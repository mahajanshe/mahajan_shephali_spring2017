Philip was born in St. Louis, Missouri on December 6, 1953. The only child of the late Senator Theodore McNeal and his wife Virgie, Philip was named after American labor movement giants A. Philip Randolph and Milton Webster. The elder McNeal worked with both men to organize the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the most prominent predominantly black labor union of its day. In 1976 Philip graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering from University of Missouri, Rolla, and began his career at Exxon Mobil as a project engineer. In 1984, Philip joined J.P. Morgan as an investment banker in the firm's Natural Resources and Power Group, and later, Managing Director and Senior Client Advisor. Philip met his true love Glenda Goodly and they married in 1989. They enjoyed a rare, enviable partnership of equals who not only loved but also truly respected each other. They were blessed with two wonderful children - daughter Sydney and son Carter. Despite his demanding career, Philip was active in his community, serving as a longtime board chair of the Montclair Human Needs Food Pantry, former trustee of Montclair Kimberley Academy, and trustee of Newark Academy. But at the very center of his life, was his devotion to Glenda, Sydney and Carter. He cherished each of them and their time together as a family. Philip found absolute contentment immersed in a finite set of passions: St. Barths, boating, Long Beach Island, and his circle of extended family and friends. They comprised an endless stream of precious memories punctuated by the unforgettable expression on Philip's face when Glenda surprised him with a 60th birthday party in January 2014. Soon after, Philip was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Philip's battle to the end with this devastating disease was marked by the same integrity, clarity, and steadiness of spirit he embodied in his work and personal life. Philip passed away at home, surrounded by those he loved most on the eve of his and Glenda's 25th wedding anniversary. Thoughtful and generous to his core, Philip would want the battle against pancreatic cancer to continue in the form of funding research so that others might be spared what he endured. A fund has been established in his honor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He is survived by Glenda, Sydney and Carter; his mother Virgie, half-brother Theodore McNeal Jr., and an extended family that loved him dearly. Few are as stellar in life as they are claimed to be in memory; Philip McNeal was, and he will remain so in our hearts, forever. Memorial service will be held on Monday, June 2nd at 6pm at the Morgan Library, 235 Madison Avenue, New York, New York.", "slideshow_credits": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MCNEAL, PHILIP WEBSTER"}], "pub_date": "2014-06-01T00:00:00Z", "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "abstract": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E6DB1E3AF932A35755C0A9629D8B63"}
