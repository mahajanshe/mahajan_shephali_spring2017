Born December 25, 1958, she grew up in Holmdel, NJ. In 1976, she graduated from Holmdel High as class president. She earned her BA from Providence College in 1980. Christina's life passion was to understand how and why people fall in love. Serving as CEO until her passing, she founded the innovative dating website FindYourFaceMate, based on the research that facial similarities spark greater chemistry, necessary for lasting love. Her pioneering efforts resulted in a unique algorithm in photo-analysis. Active in philanthropy and the arts, Christina helped underwrite theatrical and film productions, served as a board member for the Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation, and gave generously to cancer research, Operation Smile, and other causes. In this spirit of giving, she has donated her body to cancer research. She is survived by her two children; as well as her father, Vincent Maneri; eight siblings, 21 nieces and nephews, and her beloved dog. A caring mother, cool aunt, loyal sister and friend, and adoring daughter to her father and late mother, Marie, whom she missed profoundly. She joins her peacefully.
