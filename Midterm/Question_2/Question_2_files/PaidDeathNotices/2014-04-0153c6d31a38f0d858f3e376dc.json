Legendary and generous supporter of the arts leaves an enduring mark on the organizations and lives of so many individuals that she helped cultivate and enrich. She passionately and fastidiously honored the legacy of Isamu Noguchi (1904 1988) through the Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum in New York, pioneering the transformation of Long Island City into an arts destination. After nearly 30 years, we will miss collaborating with Priscilla on the Noguchi Foundation and museum. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to all who knew her.
