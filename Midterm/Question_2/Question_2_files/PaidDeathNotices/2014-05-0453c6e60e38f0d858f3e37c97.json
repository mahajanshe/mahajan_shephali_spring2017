Loyal and caring husband for 65 years to his beloved soulmate, his heart, his everything, the late Bertina Baer.

His handsome elegant attire, heart-warming smile and many kindnesses will live long in the memories of those who knew him. He is survived by sons Andrew and Nolan, daughter-in-law Colleen Griffin, cousin Alan Baer, nephews Jeffrey and Barry Neichen, and half-siblings Arlene and Arthur Isaacs.
