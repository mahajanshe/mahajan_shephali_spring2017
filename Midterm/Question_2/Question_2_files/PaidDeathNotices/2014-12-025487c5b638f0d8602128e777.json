He is the son of Irving and Adele Saypol. He is predeceased by his twin brother, Roger. He is survived by his long term partner, Florence, sister, Barbara, daughters, Cathy, Amy, Natasha and son, RD. He graduated from Dickinson College and Brooklyn Law. He was President of the Lionel Corporation. Later in Jackson Hole he became a conservationist/developer. He loved people, the outdoors, dogs and food, not necessarily in that order. A teller of stories and a giver of avuncular advice, Ron always made an entrance and exit with his presence being felt wherever he went. Contributions can be made to Jackson Hole Land Trust or the Center of the Arts. A memorial service will be held on January 7, 2015.
