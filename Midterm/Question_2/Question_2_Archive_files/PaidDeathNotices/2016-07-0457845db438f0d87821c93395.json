There was no kinder a man, no more precise a mind, no more caring a person, no more pleasingly warm a writer, no more attentive a listener, and no more humbler a person. He was an inspirational leader of great warmth, humility and sense of purpose who invested mightily in Citizens Union and guided us to a place where it could reach levels of activity and influence it had not previously known.
