Born September 9, 1924, in Lancaster, PA, Anna Barr Leonard died peacefully on May 14, 2016, in Lawrenceville, GA, after battling Alzheimer's for seven years. Her first marriage, which ended in divorce, was to Stanley C. Mason during WWII. Their three children, Helen Thilo Bigelow, Kenneth Grant Mason, and Martha Jean Mason, joined Dick's two daughters, Suzanne Sykora and Elizabeth Leonard, in an eventual extended family of almost 200 persons, which included their parents, their siblings with their families, seven grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, plus innumerable relatives and in-laws. Polly was the matriarch, delighting in the yearly family reunions. At the same time, she assisted Dick in his church and excelled in the banking world, doing investigations for Citibank CEO's Walter Wriston and John Reed. She was a marvelous cook. Her winsome spirit is missed by her family, her friends, and her congregation at the All Souls Unitarian Church, where a memorial will be held in the Fall.
