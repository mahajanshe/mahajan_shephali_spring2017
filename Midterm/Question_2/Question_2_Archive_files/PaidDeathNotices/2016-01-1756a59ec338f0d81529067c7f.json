He was the most beloved husband and best friend of his wife Marion, and the much loved father of Leslie and Philip, grandfather of Laura, Stephen, Isabella and Jacqueline, father-in-law of Larry and Sue, brother of Francoise, and uncle to many French nieces and nephews. Jacques escaped from France during World War II to join the Free French Forces, and came to the United States to complete his training as a pilot. He returned after the war to obtain his Bachelor of Science. Settling in the United States a few years later, he built a career at the Mobil Oil Company, as it was then called, where he worked for over 35 years in its international operations, ultimately specializing in the negotiation of exploration and production agreements with countries across the world. He was the kindest and most thoughtful of men, courtly, with an insatiable curiosity about world events, and a born storyteller who drew on his adventurous youth to bring to life another era for his children and grandchildren.
