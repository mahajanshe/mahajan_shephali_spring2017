Not only were you gorgeous, you were incredibly intelligent, sensitive, kind and caring. You represented everything that any man would ever desire in a wife and partner.

Dalia, you were a magnificent mother, and you so nurtured our wonderful children Cary, Ashley and Tracy, providing an enduring example of the true meaning of family. Your six grandchildren Sam, Michael, Ben, Nicholas, Olivia, and Jamie adored their Grandma Didi and will hold you forever in their hearts. Dalia, I will mourn, miss and celebrate you for the rest of my life. Thank you for the gift of 60 wonderful years together. I love you always.
