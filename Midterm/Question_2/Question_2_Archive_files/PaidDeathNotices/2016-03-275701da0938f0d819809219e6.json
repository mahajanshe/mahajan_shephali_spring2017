The Board of Directors, Friends Committee, Youth Ambassadors and staff of New Yorkers For Children (NYFC) mourn the loss of our beloved founder, Nicholas Scoppetta. Known for his lifelong commitment to public service, Nick was a champion for youth in foster care. As a young child, Nick spent years in the New York City foster care system. These early experiences shaped his drive and vision as the first Commissioner of NYC's Administration for Children Services (ACS) and founder of NYFC, the private partner to ACS. The young boy who overcame so much became an extraordinary man who touched the lives of nearly everyone he met. An innovator, visionary, and reformer, Nick devoted himself to giving kids in care the opportunity to lead lives as valuable as his became. NYFC's Board, Friends Committee, Youth Ambassadors and staff are honored to carry on his remarkable legacy. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Susan, his children, Eric and Andrea, his son-in-law, Pat, his daughter-in-law, Sally, and his beloved grandchildren Luca, Lucie, and Nicholas. 1/3", "print_page": "22", "document_type": "article", "byline": null, "multimedia": [], "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  SCOPPETTA, NICHOLAS"}, "source": "The New York Times", "blog": [], "word_count": "176", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E6D8143AF934A15750C0A9609D8B63", "slideshow_credits": null, "news_desk": "Classified", "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "snippet": "SCOPPETTA--Nicholas, (1932- 2016).
