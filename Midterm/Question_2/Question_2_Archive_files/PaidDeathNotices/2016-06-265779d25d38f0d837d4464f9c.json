British-born, New York Citybased drummer Randy Jones passed away in Calvary Hospital on Monday, June 13, 2016, of heart failure. Known as one of the most versatile drummers of his time, he was 72 years old. Randy began as a drummer in an English rock-and-roll band and became a session drummer in London before joining the Maynard Ferguson Big Band. He came to the United States in 1972, and was soon recognized for his work with such noted jazz greats as Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan and Bill Watrous. In 1978 he joined the Dave Brubeck Quartet, with which he toured and recorded for more than three decades. Randy was a passionate collector of classical records, and his drum solos reflected that interest. He is survived by his son, Thad Jones; grandsons Bryce and Peyton Jones; sister, Christine Wickham-Jones; and former wife and close friend, Laurie Beckelman. A memorial service will be held in the fall. 1/3", "print_page": "20", "document_type": "article", "byline": null, "multimedia": [], "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  JONES, RANDY"}, "source": "The New York Times", "blog": [], "word_count": "157", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E4D6103AF935A15755C0A9609D8B63", "slideshow_credits": null, "news_desk": "Classified", "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "snippet": "JONES--Randy.
