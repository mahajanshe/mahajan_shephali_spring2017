Born on November 12, 1921, and raised in Switzerland, she came to the U.S. with her husband, Gunter, in 1950. Verena trained at the Geneva Conservatory of Music and became a piano teacher and vocal coach for budding opera singers. She and her music-historian husband were founding and charter members of the Wagner Society of New York where she served as its Bayreuth coordinator for 24 years. Vreni was a very strong, independent and positive woman and was the glue that held her family together. She had a great facility for languages, traveled extensively and loved good food, chocolate and cookies. Vreni's zest for life and new experiences will be sorely missed by all of those who were fortunate enough to know her. She is survived by daughters, Christine Kossodo and Beatrice Kossodo; brothers, Peter Munger and Rolf Munger; and many cousins, nieces, nephews and loving friends. 1/3", "print_page": "22", "document_type": "article", "byline": null, "multimedia": [], "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  KOSSODO, MUNGER, VERENA"}, "source": "The New York Times", "blog": [], "word_count": "166", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E5DB153AF933A25757C0A9609D8B63", "slideshow_credits": null, "news_desk": "Classified", "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "snippet": "KOSSODO-MUNGER-- Verena, 94, beloved mother, friend and teacher, died peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, on April 3, 2016.
