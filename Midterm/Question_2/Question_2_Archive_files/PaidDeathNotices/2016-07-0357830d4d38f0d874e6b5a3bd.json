The partners, counsel, associates and staff of the firm Davis Wright Tremaine LLP note with profound sorrow the untimely death of our beloved partner Edward J. Davis on June 27, 2016 after a valiant battle with cancer. A New Jersey native, Ed graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard College and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. Ed was a Marshall Scholar and received masters' degrees from the London School of Economics and Political Science and the London School of Oriental and African Studies. His brilliant mind and devotion to their interests made him a valued advisor to his many clients who benefited from his unerring judgment. Ed's humility and generosity of spirit made him a mentor to all who had the privilege and good fortune to know and work with him. Ed was committed to providing pro bono assistance to individuals and organizations in need of assistance, and was recognized for his efforts with the Dramatists Legal Defense Fund's \"Defenders Award\" and the Arthur Liman Public Interest Award by the Legal Action Center. We extend our deepest sympathies to his husband, Tom Phillips; his mother, Marian Davis; sister, Kathleen Davis; niece, Marissa Davis; extended family, and wide network of devoted friends. A celebration of Ed's life is being planned. 1/3", "print_page": "22", "document_type": "article", "byline": null, "multimedia": [], "section_name": "Paid Death Notices", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DAVIS, EDWARD J"}, "source": "The New York Times", "blog": [], "word_count": "213", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DD113AF930A35754C0A9609D8B63", "slideshow_credits": null, "news_desk": "Classified", "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "snippet": "DAVIS--Edward J.
