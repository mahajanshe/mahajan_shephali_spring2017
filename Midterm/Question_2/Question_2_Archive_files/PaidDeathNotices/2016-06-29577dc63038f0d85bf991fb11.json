This very special, dear man, so humble, yet so kind and caring. Always calling some of us \"child\". He was and always will be a New York landmark. His appreciation of fashion, its changes and moods as shown by all people, was matched only by his appreciation and love of the arts. His Sunday pictures helped so many not for profit organizations become recognized - he was truly a man for all people. Dear Bill, you will never be forgotten, your legacy is forever! We will have a Number One at the Star Deli in your honor! With much love and great sadness.
